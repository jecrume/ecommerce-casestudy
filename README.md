# GoGo Gadget E-Commerce Website

This project was created for the case study (final project) for the Per Scholas Full Stack Java Development program. 
The [case study requirements](14-Weeks Java Developer - Case Study.pdf) can be found at this location.

The project is a fictional e-commerce website that hosts different, unique, premium tech products
from around the internet. Users can browse the website by category or product, login, logout, add items to their cart, place an order, add items
to a wish list, and search the products.

The project was created with Spring Boot, Spring MVC, Spring Security, Spring Data, Hibernate, MySQL, Maven, JS, CSS, Bootstrap
and HTML. The product images and main website images are stored in an AWS S3 storage space. A live production version of
this project is not currently deployed.
